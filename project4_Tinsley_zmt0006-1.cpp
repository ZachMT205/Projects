* HINTS :
*   Project4_hints.pdf
*   I used the zoom lecture of Dr. Li going over how to implement each function
*   I googled how to use the toLower() function for user input - https://cplusplus.com/forum/general/28440/
*   I used https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_do_while_loop.asp to refresh on do-while loops to replace while
*   I used https://cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/ to further understand pointers and how they work
*   I used https://cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/compare/ to learn how to use .compare for user input
*   I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ue2pNcRArdU to locate and fix segmentation fault
*   I used https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-the-use-of-cin-ignore-in-cplusplus to use cin.ignore() because 
*       program was skipping a line when entering an answer to question
*   I used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-to-implement-singly-linked-list-in-c-using-class/ to further understand how to
*       implement single linked lists
* Compile : g++ project4_Tinsley_zmt0006.cpp
* Run : ./a.out
